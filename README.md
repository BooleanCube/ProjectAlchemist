Alchemist Bot


This is an open-source discord bot that I worked on and published on Discord bot list. This has a lot of commands and I wouldn't recommend you waste your time counting. It has around 100+ commands and has a lot of cool features for discord bots. This bot may have a lot of cool features and commands that are cool, but keep in mind that I had started working on this bot in 2018 and that was a FAT minute ago so it might even be outdated for some commands and very inefficient. For Example, I didn't know that databases existed back in those days and instead I used txt files to store data for XP and Currency. So this might not be the best bot to refer to but it still has some cool features you can take from this. I also used to watch MenuDocs tutorials which is where some of the code for the commands come from and I recommend you watch their tutorials as well and they do more than just jda discord bot development. I don't mind you copying code character for character but just know you might have some adjusting to do and the bot is also very old and has a bunch of errors so be careful. Good luck and I hope you enjoy discord bot development!
